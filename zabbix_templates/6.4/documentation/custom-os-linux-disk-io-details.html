This field is incremented at each I/O start, I/O completion, I/O merge, or read of these stats by the number of I/Os in progress (field 12) times the number of milliseconds spent doing I/O since the last update of this field.  This can provide an easy measure of both I/O completion time and the backlog that may be accumulating</td><td></td><td></td><td></td>
